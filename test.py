What is the 2018 population of the host of the 1920 Summer Olympics that featured the country containing both the village of Wengen and the birthplace of Fränzi Aufdenblatten?<|im_end|>

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the 2018 population of the host country of the 1920 Summer Olympics, which had a village called Wengen and where Fränzi Aufdenblatten was born.

First, I need to figure out which country hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. I remember that the 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp, Belgium. But I should verify that. Let me check the web_search tool to confirm.

Once I have the host country, I need to find out if it has a village named Wengen. Wengen is a village in Switzerland, but I need to confirm if it's associated with the 1920 Olympics. Also, the birthplace of Fränzi Aufdenblatten—maybe she was born in Switzerland, and the host country of the 1920 Olympics is Switzerland? But I should check that too.

Wait, the question says the host country of the 1920 Olympics, which is Antwerp, Belgium. But if the host country is Belgium, does it have Wengen? I think Wengen is in Switzerland, so maybe the user is mixing up the countries. Alternatively, maybe the host country is Switzerland, but that's not correct. Let me confirm the host country first.

So, using the web_search tool with the query "1920 Summer Olympics host country". The results should show that the host was Antwerp, Belgium. Then, check if Antwerp has Wengen. If not, maybe the host country is another one. Wait, but Antwerp is in Belgium, and Wengen is in Switzerland. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but the question is about the host country of the 1920 Olympics, which is Belgium. Then, the country containing Wengen is Switzerland, but the host country is Belgium. Wait, the question says "the host of the 1920 Summer Olympics that featured the country containing both the village of Wengen and the birthplace of Fränzi Aufdenblatten." So the host country (Antwerp, Belgium) is the one that has the country (Switzerland) that has Wengen and where Fränzi was born. But Fränzi Aufdenblatten's birthplace is in Switzerland, so the country is Switzerland. But the host country is Belgium. So the answer would be Belgium's population in 2018, but I need to confirm.

Wait, the user is asking for the host of the 1920 Olympics (Antwerp, Belgium) and the country that contains Wengen (Switzerland) and Fränzi's birthplace (Switzerland). So the host country is Belgium, but the country with Wengen is Switzerland. So the answer is Belgium's population in 2018. But I need to check if the host country is indeed Belgium. Let me confirm that.

After confirming the host country is Belgium, then the population of Belgium in 2018 would be the answer. But I need to check the exact population. Let me use the web_search tool again to find the 2018 population of Belgium. Alternatively, if I can find the population of Antwerp, but the question is about the host country, which is Belgium. So the answer would be the population of Belgium in 2018. But I need to make sure.

So steps:

1. Search for 1920 Summer Olympics host country.
2. Confirm it's Antwerp, Belgium.
3. Check if the country containing Wengen is Switzerland.
4. The host country is Belgium, but the country with Wengen is Switzerland. So the question is about Belgium's population in 2018.
5. Find Belgium's population in 2018.

But the user might be confused, but the answer is Belgium's population. So I need to get the population of Belgium in 2018. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "2018 population of Belgium".
